Two hundred patients with fibromyalgia are randomly selected from the center for participation in the study. During recruitment, a baseline interview is conducted with each participant to obtain sociodemographic and personality data. Participants are given a study-provided portable digital device and asked to maintain a daily schedule of their fibromyalgia pain and stress levels for 30 days using two well-validated and reliable self-reporting scales. Results show a positive and statistically significant relationship between stress levels and fibromyalgia-related pain (P<.05). Similarly, statistically significant relationships were found between Type A personality participants and increased stress levels (P<.01), as well as increased levels of fibromyalgia-related pain (P<.005). Which of the following is the most appropriate method to control for the potential confounding effect of patients with a Type A personality?\nA. Matching\nB. Post hoc analysis\nC. Randomization\nD.

One hundred individuals who received Drug X died of a particular type of cancer and 100 individuals who did not receive the drug died of the same type of cancer. Based on these data, which of the following is the relative risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X as compared with individuals who do not take Drug X?\nA. Individuals who take Drug X have an equal risk of dying from this type of cancer\nB. Individuals who take Drug X have four times the risk of dying from this type of cancer\nC. Individuals who take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer\nD. Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer\nE. The risk for dying cannot be determined from the data\nAnswer: D. Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer",
