Routine medications are atorvastatin, diclofenac, and loratadine. He develops skin flushing when taking niacin, but he has no known drug allergies. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 25 years. He previously drank two beers daily, but he has not consumed any alcoholic beverages or used any recreational drugs for the past 5 years. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 104 kg (230 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits; blood pressure is 128/70 mm Hg. While standing, the patient leans forward slightly. Range of motion on lumbar extension and flexion is decreased. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities.
