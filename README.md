# Item Difficulty Prediction (Regression)

## Packages

I think the main packages used in the code are `torch` and `transformers`, others can be installed one by one. 

## Data

In the data folder, I uploaded a lot of versions. Detailed descriptions can be found in `code_preprocess/preprocess.py`. However, in most of the case, you just need to use `data/train_final_type3.json` and `data/test_final_type3.json`.

## Training scripts

Example training scripts can be found in `train_scripts_examples`.
